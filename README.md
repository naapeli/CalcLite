# CalcLite

CalcLite is a programming language designed for mathematical calculations. This project is currently on hold while I work on [DLL](https://github.com/naapeli/deep-learning-library), a deep learning library. Once DLL is finished, I will return to CalcLite.

## Current Status
Many features have already been implemented, but the next steps include adding support for arrays and objects. The end goal is to implement matrix operations and enable scientific computation within this programming language.
